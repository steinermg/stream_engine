    Decorator to poll whether a function is active and when it becomes inactive, to terminate it. Function activity is
    checked by an is_active function passed to the decorator. Activity is checked at the end of every poll_period
    seconds. Also, at the close of each poll period, if the cumulative runtime of the function exceeds max_runtime
    seconds, the function is terminated. The is_active function has access to poll_period, max_runtime, and all
    arguments passed to the wrapped function.
    :param is_active: function used to determine if the decorated function is still active
                      (e.g. if aggregation is progressing)
    :param poll_period: the frequency, in seconds, at which the is_active function is called and the decorated
                        function's runtime is checked against max_runtime
    :param max_runtime: the maximum amount of time, in seconds, that the decorated function should be allowed to run;
                        only checked at the end of each poll_period, so ideally max_runtime would be a multiple of
